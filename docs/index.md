# Ecosystem Integrity Index (EII)

Welcome to the documentation for the Ecosystem Integrity Index.

## What is EII?

The Ecosystem Integrity Index (EII) provides a spatially explicit measure of ecosystem
condition by combining functional, structural, and compositional integrity into a single score.

The index ranges from 0 to 1, where:

- **1.0** = Fully intact ecosystem (observed NPP matches natural potential)
- **0.0** = Completely degraded ecosystem (no productivity relative to potential)

EII is in active development and published as a beta-quality dataset and API.

## Features

- 🌍 **Global coverage** at 300m resolution
- 📅 **Current-state mapping** at 300m resolution
- 🐍 **Python API** for easy data access
- 🗺️ **GEE integration** for scalable analysis
